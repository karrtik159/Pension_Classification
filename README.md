Our project topic..
## Scheme Based Report Generation of Beneficiaries

In 2022, our team reached the final stage of the Gujarat SSIP AZADI KA AMRIT MAHOTSAV selection process. We were assigned a specific problem ID for the project. To tackle the problem, we created the necessary data and applied machine learning pipelines. Additionally, we developed the project to be deployed on our React.js website, using either Django or Flask as API services to handle the operations.

Example of our website:
